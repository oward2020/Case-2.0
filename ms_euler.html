        <h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>
        <img src="ms_euler.png" alt=""/>
        <p>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, 
        Leonhard Euler was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, 
        he studied under another giant of mathematics, Jean 
        Bernoulli. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics 
        and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. 
        Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all time, 
        publishing over <em>800 different books and papers.</em> His 
        influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well.</p>
        
       <p> He is perhaps best known for his research into 
        mathematical analysis. Euler's work, 
        <a &agrave;>Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748), 
        remained a standard textbook in the field for 
        well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau, 
        he wrote 
        Lettres a une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772)</a>, 
        giving a clear non-technical outline of the main 
        physical theories of the time.
        </p>
       <p>One can hardly write a mathematical equation without 
        copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such 
        as <var>e</var> and &pi;, were introduced 
        in Euler's writings. Leonhard Euler died in 1783, 
        leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and 
        certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.</p>

            <h1The Most Beautiful Equation in Math?></h1>

Perhaps the most elegant equation in the history of math is:

<code>cos(x)+isin(x)=e<sup>xi</sup></code>

which demonstrates the relationship between algebra, 
complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this 
equation, it's easy to derive the identity:

<code>e<sup>&pi;i</sup>+1=0</code>

which relates the fundamental constants: 
0, 1, &pi;, <var>e</var>, and <var>i</var> in a single beautiful and 
elegant statement. A poll of readers 
conducted by <em>The Mathematical Intelligencer</em>
magazine named Euler's Identity as the 
most beautiful theorem in the history of 
mathematics.
